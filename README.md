# MSX Cartridge

Some hardware specs (schematics + PCB designs) to build cartridges for MSX system.

This PCB can be used to mimic old cartridges for the MSX system. 
It will fit any ROM dump <64kb. Dumps larger than 64kb need a mapper, not implemented in this version.

EPROM supported is the SST39 family that can be bought for around 1.5â‚¬. This EPROM can be programmed with a standard TL866 programmer.
